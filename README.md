IDE, tools, frameworks, languages and LLM that i have chosen:

- VS Code
- Claude AI
- (react framework) Next.js 
- Python, typescript
- OpenAI API



How i built this interview prep app:

- Research the exact nature of interview preparation you want to do. This is intended as we want you to explore and get creative!

- Figure out how you are going to build the front-end, either using specific Streamlit components, or HTML/CSS in Next.js.

- Create an OpenAI API Key for this project.

- Choose one of the following OpenAI models for the project:
GPT-4.1
GPT-4.1 mini
GPT-4.1 nano
GPT-4o
GPT-4o mini

- Write at least 5 system prompts with different techniques (few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought, Zero-Shot Prompting, etc) and check which one works best for you.

- Tune at least one OpenAI setting (temperature, Top-p, frequency, etc).

- Add at least one security guard to your app to prevent misuse (eg. inject prompting)


(OPTIONAL) upgrades that I have chosen:

- Improve ChatGPT prompts for your personal domain in which you would like to interview prep: IT, finance, HR, communication, etc.

- Simulate different difficulty levels – Adjust the complexity of interview questions (easy, medium, hard).



MAIN GOALS OF THIS PROJECT
Technical Implementation:

- The learner's project works as intended; you can prepare for an interview by asking for help from the ChatGPT.

- The learner's project successfully calls the OpenAI API with the correct parameters.

- The learner successfully used a front-end library to build the UI of the project.
